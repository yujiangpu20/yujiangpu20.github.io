## About Me

I'm a Ph.D. student (2023-) in the <a href="https://www.cse.msu.edu/" target="_blank"> Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)</a> at <a href="https://msu.edu/" target="_blank"> Michigan State University (MSU)</a>, advised by Prof.<a href="https://www.egr.msu.edu/~yukong/" target="_blank"> Yu Kong</a> in the <a href="http://aiactionlab.com/" target="_blank"> ACTION Lab</a>. Previously, I received my Master's degree (2020-2023) and Bachelor's degree (2016-2020) from the <a href="https://ices.cuc.edu.cn" target="_blank"> School of Information and Communication Engineering</a>, <a href="https://www.cuc.edu.cn" target="_blank"> Communication University of China (CUC)</a>, under the guidance of Prof. <a href="https://ices.cuc.edu.cn/2019/0919/c5332a135735/page.htm" target="_blank"> Xiaoyu Wu</a> at the State Key Laboratory of Media Convergence and Communication (MCC).

I am engaged in research in **Computer Vision (CV)** and **Machine Learning (ML)**, particularly in the area of **video understanding**. I am interested in developing robust algorithms with **fewer supervised signals** and **human structured knowledge**. My early work involved violence recognition, temporal action localization, and video anomaly detection. More recently, I have been focusing on the topic of compositional generalization of vision-language models, e.g., Compositional Temporal Grounding. I am open to any positive communication and collaboration. Please feel free to contact me if you have any interest !
